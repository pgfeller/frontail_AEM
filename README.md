# Frontail for openHAB
## Streaming openHAB logs to the browser

This is a fork from the [official Frontail](https://github.com/mthenw/frontail). It is intended to work especially with openHAB log files.


## Features

*   Ability to use Regular Expressions in the highlighting rules definition
*   Use of html classes (instead of inline css rules) to define the appearance in a separate css file
*   Custom highlighting rules, intended for openHAB
*   New theming function, allowing to switch between light and dark mode in the same page (instead of having to choose among the two)
*   Use of HTML Web Storage API to remember the last used theme

## About

It started as a personal modification on the Frontail installation in my openHABian, the full story is in the first post of this thread:
<https://community.openhab.org/t/frontail-custom-theme-coloring/116673>

Long story short, some modifications where made to the following files:
```
web/index.html
web/assets/app.js
```

And some files were added:
```
preset/openhab_AEM.json
web/assets/styles/openhab_AEM.css
```


## Thanks

Thanks to the work of [Ethan Dye](https://github.com/ecdye) this is also the standard Frontail version on [OpenHABian](https://github.com/openhab/openhabian) starting from version 1.6.4: you can install it using openhabian-config, menu 21.

I would also like to thank [Schnuecks](https://github.com/Schnuecks) for helping me and giving some great suggestions. He also created a Repository for the installation via docker image, you can find it [here](https://github.com/Schnuecks/frontail_AEM).
